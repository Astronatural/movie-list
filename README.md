# A List of Certain Movies

## Description


It's a list of some movies.  You can click on a poster to learn more about that movie.
Don't like those movies?  Just add your own!


## Prerequisites/Installation

Just "npm install", you should be good to go.  That is, as long as you remember to set up two terminals to enter "npm run server" and "npm run client".  Having a database where you run the SQL commands found in "database/database.sql" is key to utilizing this app too.  Be sure to name your database "MovieList".  You won't have access to any of the movies I added, sorry.   But hey, you can probably add any number of your own.  What are the chances we liked the same movies anyway?


## Usage

What you want to do is scroll around the movie-list and see if something strikes your fancy.  Click on it and see what happens.  

Now you are faced with a heap of facts, straight from Wikipedia, about the movie you clicked on.  I bet you didn't know half of that.

At anytime you can click on the text "Add a movie by clicking here!" to, guess what, go to a page where you too can enter a movie.
To do this you will need 3-4 things; a title of the movie, a URL where an image related to the movie can be found (it's kinda set up to go with posters) then you want to go over to wikipedia and copy some stuff from the "summary" at the top of the page and post that in the description textarea.  Feel free to invent your own description though.  After that click on "Choose a genre" to select a genre for the movie you are adding.

If you really want to use this, go ahead.   I am not going to pretend I own any of the images or related films.  I am not trying to be sued by Disney.


## Acknowledgement

This probably wouldn't have gotten even to the state it is in without the help of Cody.  He's a pretty cool guy!  Shout Out to Quinn as well!

I can't forget Blaine helping me through some tough points and helping me wrap my head around a brick wall or two...

And, of course, thanks to Prime Digital Academy.  I would probably just have played video games all weekend without their help and guidance.
